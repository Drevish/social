switch from storing user in the session to using spring authentication
and if we're changing email or password just reauthenticate user

add
# Use InnoDB engine
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL55Dialect
to application.properties
and maybe create repos tests

replace entities with dtos everywhere if

use mapping id:
split user into two separate classes: user(email, password, roles) and userInfo(name, surname, etc)

TRY TO USE:
jpa inheritance
jpa auditioning and version control
jpa custom id
